I recently learned that my job is being outsourced. The favorite part of my current job is when I get to write PowerShell to solve problems so with that in mind, Iâ€™m going see this opportunity to teach myself web development with the intent of becoming a web developer.

I already understand lots of development concepts because of my experience with PowerShell. I use and understand VS Code, git, patterns and practices etc. I have lots to learn when it comes to working with a team of other developers, who are all working on the same things though; I look forward to the opportunity.

## My Plan

Every article Iâ€™ve read as part of my research says to learn HTML/CSS, vanilla JavaScript then pick a framework. Iâ€™m undecided on the framework just yet but if my Twitter TL is any indication, React is super popular with Angular, TypeScript and Vue also getting lots of mentions. 

Iâ€™m currently working my way through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design Certification. Iâ€™ll also be working through the [Codecademy Web Development](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development) paid course.

I learn by doing so getting stuff to show up on the page is super rewarding. I usually learn best when I just hack around and google to figure things out. Then I like to go back and read about the things Iâ€™m just copying and pasting and reading closer on the topics I donâ€™t fully understand by experimenting. Because of that, I expect this site to go through many iterations as Iâ€™m learning new things.

Iâ€™m currently on the HTML/CSS phase as I really want to make sure Iâ€™m really and truly understanding the concepts at this phase. Semantic HTML, Accessible HTML and CSS Flexbox, site design and color theory as it relates to site design, Figma. I want to be able to design and build a site and make it look nice without having to just steal other peopleâ€™s designs.

Wish me luck. ðŸ˜Ž
