Rachelle and I just finished watching The Wire. I’ve watched it once before and I’m glad to know that it’s still a pretty great show. I think my tastes have developed a bit because while I think it’s still a pretty great show, I saw some problems that I don’t remember seeing the first time thru a decade ago.

Seasons 3 and 4 are my favorite and seasons 2 and 5 my least.

Overall, still a great show and is required viewing IMO.
